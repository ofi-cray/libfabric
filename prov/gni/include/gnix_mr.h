/**
 * @note The GNIX memory registration cache has the following properties:
 *         - Not thread safe
 *         - The hard registration limit includes the number of stale entries.
 *             Stale entries will be evicted to make room for new entries as
 *             the registration cache becomes full.
 *         - Allows multiplexing of libfabric memory registrations onto a
 *             single GNIX memory registration so long as the libfabric
 *             registration can be contained wholly within the GNIX memory
 *             registration.
 *         - Uses a LRU cache eviction scheme. This should reduce the overall
 *             calls to reg/dereg in the underlying layers when the user
 *             application consistently sends messages from the same buffers
 *             but continually registers and deregisters those regions. The
 *             LRU is implemented as a queue using a doubly linked list for
 *             fast removal/insertion.  Note that this is an
 *             approximate LRU scheme, because the find function may
 *             return a larger entry in the stale tree.
 *         - By default, there is no limit to the number of 'inuse'
 *             registrations in the cache. This can be changed by passing
 *             in a set of attributes during _gnix_mr_cache_init.
 *         - By default, there is a limit of 128 stale entries in the cache.
 *             This is done to limit the amount of unused entries to retain.
 *             Some traffic patterns may burst traffic across a network,
 *             potentially leaving stale entries unused for long periods of
 *             time. Some stale entries may never be reused by an application.
 *             This value may also be changed by passing in a set of attributes
 *             during _gnix_mr_cache_init.
 *
 * The memory registration framework is based on the design of a two tree
 * system for fast lookups. The first tree is a red-black tree for O(lg n)
 * search times. The second tree is a Left Child - Right Sibling (lrcs) tree
 * for the slower path. The combination of the two trees allows the memory
 * registration cache to provide fast lookups while providing a minimal set
 * of registrations to work from. The intent of the design is to minimize the
 * number of occurrences where memory must be registered with the NIC.
 *
 * Registering a new region of memory with the NIC is computationally
 * expensive. This can be avoided by caching registrations and reusing existing
 * registrations. The caching portion is easy, since we can store the
 * registrations in any form we choose, so long as there is a data structure
 * that supports it. The minimization of registrations is actually difficult.
 *
 * The first approach taken in this endeavor was a red-black tree with a
 * two property comparison. It was noted that this could not work because some
 * elements would be inaccessible after a rebalance, so we changed the design
 * to use a single property(address) comparison. This eliminated the bug but
 * did not allow a minimal set of registrations because the second
 * property(length) was the one which helped to identify overlapping regions.
 *
 * To remedy the issue caused by the bug fix, the last and current approach
 * uses two different tree structures to organize the memory registrations.
 *
 * The fastpath utilizes the red-black tree for O(lg n) search times where
 * the user is attempting to register a memory region where there is already
 * a pre-existing registration at the same base address. By searching for the
 * base address, we can check the length of the registration to see if it can
 * satisfy the address. If it can satisfy the request, we are done.
 *
 * The slowpath utilizes the lcrs tree for O(n) search times.
 * A left-child-right-sibling tree is an organization of data in a tree-like
 * form where children are subsets of the parents, and siblings are distinct
 * elements. For the case used in the memory registration cache, children
 * are subsumable registrations to the parent, and siblings are non-subsumable
 * registrations. By organizing data in this manner, we only need to search
 * the siblings of the root to find a registration that would satisfy the
 * request, as subsumed registrations would already be provided by an entry
 * in the root sibling list. Performance of an application is improved by the
 * slow path as reuse of registrations increases. Larger registrations further
 * improve the runtime of the slow path by subsuming existing entries if
 * possible.
 *
 * The slowpath and fastpath approaches are applied to the stale registration
 * cache, which also provides LRU functionality. The stale registration cache
 * drops/deletes entries that can be subsumed by existing entries to reduce
 * the number of memory registrations and prevent larger registrations from
 * being ejected via LRU.
 *
 * A number of assumptions are being made:
 *   - When a lookup is being performed, no one else can modify the cache.
 *   - Since no one can modify the cache while a lookup is occurring, certain
 *     search criteria can be bypassed since we know a subsumable entry could
 *     not have existed if a later search method is called.
 *   - Since earlier methods could have found a registration but did not, then
 *     some insertion criteria can be assumed to decrease the amount of
 *     instructions necessary to create a new registration.
